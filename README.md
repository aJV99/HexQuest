## What is it?
Hex Quest is a unique blend of strategy and adventure, set on a hex-based map. As a would-be conqueror, you'll navigate this intricate world, face formidable foes, and gather resources. Your mission? Defeat the final boss in his stronghold and seize the kingdom.

## How to Play
1. **Identify Your Player**: Look for the cylinder with a green sphere above it.
2. **Understand Your Stats**: Keep an eye on Power, Gold, and Moves Remaining. If your power drops to zero, it's game over!
3. **Navigate**: Click on your player to see available tiles for movement. Choose your path by clicking the desired tile.
4. **Engage in Battles**: Approach an enemy's tile to initiate a battle. A warning pop-up will appear.
5. **Manage Your Moves**: You have a limited number of moves before requiring rest. Refill your move count at towns or taverns. If you're out of gold or can't find a resting place in time, you'll sleep rough, depleting your power.
