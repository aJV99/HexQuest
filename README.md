# Hex Quest

## Description
Hex Quest is a strategy game set in a medieval environment where the player navigates through a hex-based kingdom. The objective is to strategize, battle enemies, and amass gold, all while maintaining the player's power. The ultimate goal? Conquer the final boss in his castle and claim the kingdom.

## Features
- **Tile-Based Navigation**: The hexagonal tiles guide the player's movement and decisions.
- **Strategic Battles**: Encounter enemies and decide whether to engage or avoid based on your power.
- **Resource Management**: Collect gold to power up, heal, or recruit troops, and manage your turns efficiently to avoid penalties.
- **Dynamic Terrain**: Traverse through roads, grass, mountains, lakes, and more, each influencing your path and strategy.
- **Pop-up Notifications**: Informative pop-ups guide the player through battles, town visits, and other game events.

## How to Play
1. **Identify Your Player**: Look for the cylinder with a green sphere above it.
2. **Understand Your Stats**: Keep an eye on Power, Gold, and Moves Remaining. If your power drops to zero, it's game over!
3. **Navigate**: Click on your player to see available tiles for movement. Choose your path by clicking the desired tile.
4. **Engage in Battles**: Approach an enemy's tile to initiate a battle. A warning pop-up will appear.
5. **Manage Your Moves**: You have a limited number of moves before requiring rest. Refill your move count at towns or taverns. If you're out of gold or can't find a resting place in time, you'll sleep rough, depleting your power.
